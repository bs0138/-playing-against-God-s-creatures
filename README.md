I am not good at English,sorry about that.

"In physics you’re playing against God, and He doesn’t change his laws very often. In finance, you’re playing against God’s creatures, agents who value assets based on their ephemeral opinions."-Emanuel Derman

Financial Modelers’ Manifesto
The Modelers’ Hippocratic Oath reads as follows:
“I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it doesn’t satisfy my equations.”
“Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.”
“I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.”
“Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.”
“I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, many of them beyond my comprehension.”
